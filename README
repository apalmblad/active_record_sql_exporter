ActiveRecordSqlExporter
=======================

This plugin takes a record in your database and converts it into SQL statements
that can be used to insert it.

This was written after I had to restore some specific data for a user (a number
of rows, across a number of tables.)  

It might be useful as a simple backup utility - for example, store the restoration
sql after something gets removed.


Example
=======

Obj.find( obj_id ).to_sql
